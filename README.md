# Shot-counter
This project started out as a simple visual hit counter for steel plate matches. The sensor senses the impact of a bullet on the steel plate, and sends the registered hit back to the receiver. Multiple sensors can be used to send data back to the receiver.

Currently tested with 9mm, 5.56, and 7.62 calibers.
